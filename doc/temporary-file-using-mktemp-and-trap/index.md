# Temporary file using `mktemp` and `trap`

To create a temporary file:

```sh
file=$(mktemp)
```

Why use `mktemp` instead of `tempfile`? 

  * Because `mktemp` is available on more systems.

To remove a temporary file when the program exist:

```sh
trap "rm -f $file" EXIT
```

Why trap on EXIT, instead of TERM, INT, HUP? 

  * Because EXIT covers all the cases.
